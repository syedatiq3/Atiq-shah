<br></br><b> Dear Assalam o alaikum,</b>
<br></br>I have not heard from you for a long time. I am sure you are in good health.
<br></br>Last week, I visited Neelum Valley. I went there with my family. We were informed that the food available
at the restaurants inthat place is not good so we took our own food with us. The place was overly crowded. The Neelum river
 was flowing claimly. I saw many hawkers there selling snacks, drinks, newspapers, etc.
I enjoyed my visit to Neelum valley a lot. I am sending you some o the photographs o this beautiful place. I hope 
you would like them.
                              <br></br><u>With best wishes</u>.
                               <br></br><u>Your sincerely</u>,
                                       <br></br><u>X.Y.Z</u>.</p>
